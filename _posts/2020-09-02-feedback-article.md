Feedback occurs when an environment reacts to an action or behavior. Every day in our life we giving and receiving feedbacks: we say hello to a friend we meet, we become happy by watching a comedy, and we are upset if we enter an examination room. Emotional reactions underlie the concept of feedback.

In a company environment, A feedback turns to the process that describes how the result of a task performed by a person is reflecting on that person, to suggest how to correct and/or improve itself.

Feedback can be split into three meaningful stages:

1. **Feedback \ Reflection**: Focused on what you have reached until today;
2. **Feedup \ Goal Setting**: Focused on what you want to achieve tomorrow;
3. **Feedforward \ Future**: Focused on the actions to perform based on the previous ones.

## Why feedbacks are so important?

The Feedback is an asset for companies and its workers because it allows to create a “communication channel” between the people, encourage collaboration, transparency, build loyalty. From the employer's perspective allow understanding the employees needs, the improvement areas and general monitoring of their work-force. For some companies, this aspect can be evaluated as time waste; instead, be aware of this status means to be interested in company performance and how to improve it.

From the employees perspective, it allows a personal and professional growth, by understanding which corrections perform along their job’s journey. Lack of feedback suggests disinterest and often it’s the root cause of a lose-lose scenario; a very common and uncontrolled feed-forward is the quit of the employees.

## The characteristics of good feedback

Profitable feedback should observe these rules:

- No Prejudices and Free from personal involvement or likings;
- Planned frequently;
- Respectful;
- Can be Positive or Negative and in both cases, must includes suggestions;
- Bidirectional.
