Just like how people are excited about updating their mobile apps and OS,
developers should also be excited to update their frameworks. The new version of
the different frameworks come with new features and tricks out of the box.

Below are some of the good features you should consider when migrating your
existing app to React 16 from React 15.

### Error Handling

React 16 introduces the new concept of an *error boundary*.

Error boundaries are React components that **catch JavaScript errors anywhere in
their child component tree**. They log those errors and display a
fallback UI instead of the crashed component tree. Error boundaries catch
errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole
tree below them.

A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method
called `componentDidCatch(error, info)`:

```
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // Display fallback UI
    this.setState({ hasError: true });
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

Then you can use it as a regular component.

```
<ErrorBoundary>
    <MyWidget />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

The `componentDidCatch()` method works like a JavaScript `catch {}` block, but
for components. Only class components can be error boundaries. In practice, most
of the time you‚Äôll want to declare an error boundary component once. Then you‚Äôll
use it throughout your application.

Note that **error boundaries only catch errors in the components below
them in the tree**. An error boundary can‚Äôt catch an error within
itself. If an error boundary fails trying to render the error message, the error
will propagate to the closest error boundary above it. This, too, is similar to
how `catch {}` block works in JavaScript.

### New render return types: fragments and strings

Get rid of wrapping the component in a div while rendering.

You can now return an array of elements from a component‚Äôs `render` method.Like
with other arrays, you‚Äôll need to add a key to each element to avoid the key
warning:

```
render() {
  // No need to wrap list items in an extra element!
  return [
    // Don't forget the keys :)
    <li key="A">First item</li>,
    <li key="B">Second item</li>,
    <li key="C">Third item</li>,
  ];
}
```

[Starting with React
16.2.0](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/11/28/react-v16.2.0-fragment-support.html),
it has support for a special fragment syntax to JSX that doesn‚Äôt require keys.

Support for returning strings :

```
render() {
  return 'Look ma, no spans!';
}
```

### Portals

Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists
outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

```
ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)
```

The first argument (`child`) is any [renderable React
child](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#render), such as an
element, string, or fragment. The second argument (`container`) is a DOM
element.

#### **How to use it**

When you return an element from a component‚Äôs render method, it‚Äôs mounted into
the DOM as a child of the nearest parent node:

```
render() {
  // React mounts a new div and renders the children into it
  return (
    <div>
      {this.props.children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Sometimes it‚Äôs useful to insert a child into a different location in the DOM:

```
render() {
  // React does *not* create a new div. It renders the children into `domNode`.
  // `domNode` is any valid DOM node, regardless of its location in the DOM.
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(
    this.props.children,
    domNode
  );
}
```

A typical use case for portals is when a parent component has an `overflow:
hidden` or `z-index` style, but you need the child to visually ‚Äúbreak out‚Äù of
its container. For example, dialogs, hovercards, and tooltips.

### Custom DOM Attribute

React15 used to ignore any unknown DOM attributes. It would just skip them since
React didn‚Äôt recognize it.

```
// Your code:
<div mycustomattribute="something" />
```

Would render an empty div to the DOM with React 15:

```
// React 15 output:
<div />
```

In React16, the output will be the following (*custom attributes will be shown
and not be ignored at all*):

```
// React 16 output:
<div mycustomattribute="something" />
```

### Avoid Re-render with setting NULL in state

With React16 you can prevent state updates and re-renders right from
`setState()`. You just need to have your function return `null`.

```
const MAX_PIZZAS = 20;

function addAnotherPizza(state, props) {
// Stop updates and re-renders if I've had enough pizzas.
if (state.pizza === MAX_PIZZAS) {
    return null;
}

// If not, keep the pizzas coming! :D
return {
    pizza: state.pizza + 1,
}
}

this.setState(addAnotherPizza);
```

### Creating Refs

Creating refs with React16 is now much easier. Why you need to use refs:

* Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
* Triggering imperative animations.
* Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

Refs are created using `React.createRef()` and are attached to React elements
via the `ref` attribute. Refs are commonly assigned to an instance property when
a component is constructed so they can be referenced throughout the component.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.myRef = React.createRef();
    }
    render() {
        return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
    }
}
```


#### **Accessing Refs**

When a ref is passed to an element in `render`, a reference to the node becomes
accessible at the `current` attribute of the ref.

```
const node = this.myRef.current;
```

The value of the ref differs depending on the type of the node:

* When the `ref` attribute is used on an HTML element, the `ref` created in the
constructor with `React.createRef()` receives the underlying DOM element as its
`current` property.
* When the `ref` attribute is used on a custom class component, the `ref` object
receives the mounted instance of the component as it's `current`.
* You may not use the `ref` attribute on functional components because
they don‚Äôt have instances.

### Context API

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to
pass props down manually at every level.

#### `React.createContext`

```
const {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue);
```

Creates a `{ Provider, Consumer }` pair. When React renders a context
`Consumer`, it will read the current context value from the closest matching
`Provider` above it in the tree.

The `defaultValue` argument is **only** used by a Consumer when it does not have
a matching Provider above it in the tree. This can be helpful for testing
components in isolation without wrapping them. Note: passing `undefined` as a
Provider value does not cause Consumers to use `defaultValue`.

#### `Provider`

```
<Provider value={/* some value */}>
```


A React component that allows Consumers to subscribe to context changes.

Accepts a `value` prop to be passed to Consumers that are descendants of this
Provider. One Provider can be connected to many Consumers. Providers can be
nested to override values deeper within the tree.

#### `Consumer`

```
<Consumer>
    {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
</Consumer>
```


A React component that subscribes to context changes.

Requires a [function as a
child](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#using-props-other-than-render).
The function receives the current context value and returns a React node. The
`value` argument passed to the function will be equal to the `value` prop of the
closest Provider for this context above in the tree. If there is no Provider for
this context above, the `value` argument will be equal to the `defaultValue`
that was passed to `createContext()`.

### `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`

`getDerivedStateFromProps` is invoked right before calling the render method.
Both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. It should return an object
to update the state, or null to update nothing.

This method exists for [rare use
cases](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#when-to-use-derived-state)
where the state depends on changes in props over time. For example, it might be
handy for implementing a `<Transition>` component that compares its previous and
next children to decide which of them to animate in and out.

Deriving state leads to verbose code and makes your components difficult to
think about.

[Make sure you‚Äôre familiar with simpler
alternatives:](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html)

* If you need to **perform a side effect** (for example, data fetching or an
animation) in response to a change in props, use `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle
instead.
* If you want to **re-compute some data only when a prop changes**, [use a
memoization helper
instead](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#what-about-memoization).
* If you want to **‚Äúreset‚Äù some state when a prop changes**, consider either
making a component [fully
controlled](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#recommendation-fully-controlled-component)
or [fully uncontrolled with a
](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#recommendation-fully-uncontrolled-component-with-a-key)`key`
instead.

This method doesn‚Äôt have access to the component instance. If you‚Äôd like, you
can reuse some code between `getDerivedStateFromProps()` and the other class
methods by extracting pure functions of the component props and state outside
the class definition.

Note that this method is fired on *every* render, regardless of the cause. This
is in contrast to `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps`. It only fires when the
parent causes a re-render and not as a result of a local `setState`.

We compare `nextProps.someValue` with `this.props.someValue.` If both are
different then we perform some operation, `setState`

```
static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState){
    if(nextProps.someValue!==prevState.someValue){
        return { someState: nextProps.someValue};
    }else return null;
}
```

It receives two params `nextProps` and `prevState`. As mentioned previously,you
cannot access `this` inside this method. You‚Äôll have to store the props in the
state to compare the `nextProps` with previous props. In above code `nextProps`
and `prevState` are compared. If both are different then an object will be
returned to update the state. Otherwise `null` will be returned indicating state
update not required. If state changes then `componentDidUpdate` is called where
we can perform the desired operations as we did in `componentWillReceiveProps`.

### Bonus: React Lifecycle events
